## Modules and Dependencies
This project utilizes the following Python libraries and modules to achieve its functionality:

**SpeechRecognition**: This library is used to convert speech into text, enabling voice input for the assistant.

**Pyttsx3**: Pyttsx3 is used for text-to-speech conversion, allowing the assistant to respond with spoken language.

**Open AI**: Integrated with CHAT GPT to have a more user friendly conversational response. 

**Wikipedia**: The Wikipedia module enables the assistant to search and retrieve information from the Wikipedia online encyclopedia.

**Wolfram Alpha**: This library integrates with the Wolfram Alpha computational knowledge engine, which can provide answers to a wide range of questions and perform calculations. Set up an API key for authentication on Wolfram Alpha developer page to use this module. 

**Pygame**: Pygame is used for playing audio and managing sound, enhancing the assistant's interactivity.

Happy Coding !
